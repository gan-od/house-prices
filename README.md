This is my first Kaggle project - House prices analysis using Linear Regression

The competition is posted on Kaggle under the name "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" and can be found at the link below:

The notebook includes detailed description on the steps I took to get the result of RSLE = 0.132 and rank in the top 35% from 5169 teams.

In the project, I predicted house prices from a collection of 2930 houses in Ames, Iowa,
each with 80 (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) features such as 'number of bathrooms above ground', and 'size of front lawn'.
